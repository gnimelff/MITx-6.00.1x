'''
Write a program that calculates the minimum fixed monthly payment needed in order pay off a credit card balance within 12 months. By a fixed monthly payment, we mean a single number which does not change each month, but instead is a constant amount that will be paid each month.

monthlyinterest = annualInterestRate / 12
test = (balance // 12) - (balance // 12 % 10)
original_balance = balance

while True:
    for months in range(1, 13):
        balance -= test
        balance += (balance * monthlyinterest)
    if balance <= 0:
        break
    else:
        balance = original_balance
        test += 10

print('Lowest payment: ' + str(test))
